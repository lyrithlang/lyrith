# This is Lyrith.

Lyrith is a personal project to essentially mash together elements of other programming languages and concepts from talks I found interesting.

- **Highly performant** via Just-in-Time _and_ Ahead-of-Time compilation
- **Highly concurrent** via lightweight actor-model concurrent threads  
  _Inspired by Go, Elixir, Pony_
- **Robust** via fault tolerance and non-halting errors  
  _Inspired by Elixir, Zig_
- **Memory safe** via borrow checking and capability-based security  
  _Inspired by Rust and Pony_
- **Runtime debuggable** (in specific execution modes)
- **Simple** via no hidden control flow, memory allocations, preprocessing and macros  
  _Inspired by Zig_
- **Easy** to read and write, with syntatic roots in _Python_
